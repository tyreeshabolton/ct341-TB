                        <h2>Apple to charge 27% fee for Dutch dating apps using alternative payment options</h2>      
                        <p> Following a court order, developers working on dating apps don’t have to use Apple’s in-app purchase system in the Netherlands. And because those purchases aren’t handled by Apple, the company doesn’t take its usual 30% cut on digital purchases. But developers who use a third-party payment system still have to pay a commission. And Apple plans to charge a… 27% commission.</p>
                        <p>If you haven’t kept track of the Dutch antitrust saga, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets originally said that Apple was in breach of national competition rules on a very specific case — digital content sold by dating app developers, such as superlikes and boosts.</p>
                        <p>This represents yet another threat for Apple’s in-app payment system. In South Korea, Apple agreed to allow third-party payment systems following a new law on digital payments. There are also several ongoing cases in the U.S. and Euro</p>
                        <p>As for the Netherlands, Apple has appealed the antitrust ruling, saying that allowing external payments wasn’t in the users’ best interests.</p>
